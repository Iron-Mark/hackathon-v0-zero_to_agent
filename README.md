# HireProof

AI-powered job post verification for spotting suspicious listings before someone applies.

HireProof takes a pasted job post, recruiter message, screenshot, or job URL and returns a structured verdict: `safe`, `caution`, or `high-risk`. The agent extracts claims, checks company presence, searches reputation signals, compares similar jobs, verifies local footprint, and shows the evidence behind the score.

## Current Status

HireProof is implemented as a production Next.js app with web UI, headless API, MCP tools, ChatSDK routes, WDK workflow entrypoint, Docker packaging, and a Chrome extension package workflow.

What is complete in this repo:

- Web audit flow with text, job URL, screenshot upload, pasted screenshot, and voice input.
- Screenshot OCR path with Google Vision first, Tesseract fallback, image preprocessing, and OCR evidence receipts.
- Public job URL enrichment for supported LinkedIn, ATS, and public career pages before scoring.
- Screenshot-derived reports excluded from Explore and Trends by default; direct report links still work.
- Demo-mode seeded scenarios that work without API keys.
- Live-mode investigation path using model and search provider credentials.
- Headless `/api/v1/audit` endpoint with API-key auth and webhook support.
- MCP endpoint and investigation tools.
- ChatSDK webhook adapters for Slack, Discord, and Telegram.
- Public Discord server install link for adding the HireProof app: <https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1500240100804530336&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=0>.
- Discord slash commands: `/verify job_post:<text-or-link>` checks a suspicious job post, expands supported public job URLs, and `/help` explains how to use HireProof in Discord.
- Vercel Workflow / WDK audit start route.
- Published npm packages for the CLI, LangChain tool, TypeScript SDK, and n8n node; Make Custom App source pack; plus portable HTTP templates.
- HireProof CLI with rich terminal reports, an Ink-based Shield Sentinel TUI, Tab autocomplete, local report history, and theme-aware proof screenshots.
- Shareable audit reports, history, trends, PDF dossier, CSV export, PNG export, and safe-report certificate.
- Verified badge API and developer portal controls.
- Dockerfile, Compose service, healthcheck, and smoke script for self-hosting.
- Manifest V3 Chrome extension with store-ready ZIP, current screenshots, promo assets, listing copy, and privacy notes.

Output and sharing capabilities:

- **PNG Screenshot Export**: capture the visible report for demos and quick sharing.
- **Forensic PDF Dossier**: download a structured investigation dossier.
- **Report CSV Export**: export verdict, claims, signals, evidence, and next steps for review.

Honest external boundaries:

- Chrome Web Store publication requires the Chrome Web Store developer dashboard, privacy form, uploaded screenshots, and Google review. This repo prepares the upload package and assets listed in [`docs/assets-index.md`](docs/assets-index.md); it cannot publish the listing by itself.
- npm packages are published for the CLI, LangChain tool, TypeScript SDK, and n8n node. Make Custom App review and any n8n directory/community verification remain external account-backed steps.
- Docker smoke testing requires Docker Desktop or another Docker runtime. The scripts are present, but the local machine must have Docker available.
- Live ChatSDK proof is captured for Slack and Telegram. Discord is credential-ready but still needs a real provider-event screenshot/log before live proof is claimed.
- WDK proof is currently an accepted production workflow run. Do not claim a completed long-running workflow result until a completed result and callback proof are captured.

Do not overclaim:

- Do not call HireProof a generic security platform.
- Do not claim adaptive ML, continuous learning, or in-house deepfake detection as shipped.
- Do not claim completed WDK workflow proof until a completed result is captured.
- Keep competitor comparisons high-level unless the competitor claims have been independently verified.
- Require independently verified proof before naming competitor-specific superiority claims.

## Competitive Positioning And Roadmap

HireProof focuses on employment fraud first because job scams happen in urgent, personal, high-risk moments where users need an actionable verdict, not a generic fraud dashboard. The narrow domain is the wedge, not the ceiling: the same evidence core is already exposed through the web app, API, MCP tools, ChatSDK agents, and WDK workflow entrypoint.

The risk model is intentionally framed as a transparent evidence-weighted safety policy. HireProof does not claim continuous machine learning or in-house deepfake detection today. Instead, it shows users which red flags, green flags, and evidence receipts drove the verdict so a job seeker can understand the decision before sharing money or personal data.

Roadmap:

- Near-term: capture Discord live-provider proof and re-capture the final Telegram report-link screenshot.
- Next product milestone: show a durable investigation timeline for WDK with intake, evidence checks, scoring, report creation, callback, and retry history.
- Model milestone: explore calibrated learning from reviewed cases as roadmap-only work while preserving explainable red-flag evidence.
- Multimodal milestone: improve screenshot/OCR analysis and integrate specialist image or deepfake forensics providers only when third-party proof adds real evidence.

## Hackathon Track Coverage

HireProof is one verification agent exposed through multiple delivery surfaces.

| Track | What is implemented | Proof notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v0 + MCPs | Next.js app, audit workspace, evidence tools, and MCP endpoint. | Strongest primary product flow. |
| ChatSDK Agents | Shared ChatSDK bot wrapper plus Slack, Discord, and Telegram webhook routes. | Slack has screenshot proof, Telegram has delivery screenshot/log proof, and Discord is credential-ready. |
| Vercel Workflow / WDK | Workflow package enabled, `startAuditWorkflow`, and `/api/workflows/audit` start route. | Production accepted run captured in proof docs. |

More detail: [`docs/triple-track-coverage.md`](docs/triple-track-coverage.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3002> and go to `/audit`.

Demo fixture mode works without keys and is labeled as fixture data. For live evidence, configure model and search credentials in `.env.local`.

For the current behavior boundary, see [`docs/current-audit-behavior.md`](docs/current-audit-behavior.md).

## Recommended Demo Script

Use this path when showing the project to a judge, reviewer, or stakeholder:

1. Open <https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/audit>.
2. Select or paste the high-risk demo text:

```text
Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Message us on Telegram.
```

3. Run the audit and show the streamed investigation steps.
4. Open the final report and point out the verdict, score, evidence, flags, and next steps.
5. Show the same core agent through the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/api/v1/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: hireproof_agent_demo_key" \
  -d '{"text":"Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Message us on Telegram.","mode":"demo"}'
```

6. Mention the distribution surfaces: MCP tools, ChatSDK agents, WDK workflow, Docker self-hosting, and Chrome extension package.
7. Be explicit about boundaries: Chrome Store publication and Docker runtime verification depend on external account/runtime access.

### Current Trust Model

- **Live evidence mode** runs the real evidence path when credentials are configured: claim extraction, job URL enrichment, OCR where needed, SerpApi-backed search/jobs/news/maps checks, scoring, and streamed report events.
- **Demo fixture mode** is labeled and should not be described as live evidence. It shows deterministic fixture reports for walkthroughs and offline testing.
- **Timeline honesty**: browser reports use captured stream events when live mode runs; demo reports show fixture events rather than precise fake timings.
- **Verified-only safer alternatives**: alternatives appear only when comparable job evidence has a real source URL or provider-backed metadata.
- **False-positive controls**: remote startup mode explains why missing local-office evidence may not hurt the score when digital footprint and apply-path signals are consistent.
- **SerpApi circuit breaker and queue throttling**: expensive live audits are protected by per-user/per-IP throttling, cache reuse, similarity cache, and circuit-breaker status.

## Core Workflows

### Web Audit

The main workflow lives at `/audit`.

- Paste a job listing or recruiter message. On desktop, the main paste box focuses when the audit page opens so users can paste text or a screenshot immediately.
- Paste a public job URL when available; HireProof expands supported LinkedIn, ATS, and public careers pages before scoring.
- Upload or paste a screenshot. Google Vision OCR runs first; Tesseract fallback runs after OCR-oriented image preprocessing when needed.
- Use browser speech-to-text for voice input.
- Watch the Server-Sent Events stream as the agent extracts claims and calls tools.
- Review the verdict, risk score, flags, OCR/source evidence receipts, and recommended next steps.

Screenshot privacy behavior:

- The raw screenshot is not stored as a report evidence item.
- OCR text is used for analysis and shown as a short display-safe preview in report UI.
- Screenshot-based reports are marked not publicly listed by default, so they are excluded from `/explore` and `/trends`.

### Headless API

`POST /api/v1/audit` returns JSON for external agents and automation tools.

```bash
curl -X POST https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/api/v1/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: hireproof_agent_demo_key" \
  -d '{"text":"Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Message us on Telegram.","mode":"demo"}'
```

### MCP Tools

`POST /api/mcp` exposes investigation tools for agent runtimes:

- Company presence search.
- News and reputation search.
- Comparable job search.
- Local business footprint search.

### Developer Portal

The `/developer` page supports:

- Account login and API key management.
- Domain verification for badge embeds.
- Webhook sandbox testing.
- BYOK provider credential storage for authenticated audits.

Provider credentials are verified before storage and encrypted server-side. Secrets are not returned to the browser after save.

## Builder Story

HireProof is useful as a user-facing app, but the stronger technical story is that the same verification core is exposed to builders through multiple interfaces:

- **Web app** for job seekers who want a verdict before applying.
- **Headless API** for agents that need a structured job-safety gate.
- **MCP tools** for evidence-gathering runtimes.
- **n8n npm package and Make source pack** for no-code and operations workflows.
- **LangChain npm package** for agent pipelines using structured tools.
- **HireProof CLI npm package** for terminal audits, scripted JSON output, health checks, and a branded interactive TUI.
- **ChatSDK adapters** for job-seeker communities in Slack, Telegram, and Discord channels.
- **WDK route** for durable investigation handoff when workflow credentials are configured.

The current repo-controlled automation status is implemented, validated, and source-packaged. Public marketplace listings are intentionally tracked as external next steps.

## What Makes It Agentic

HireProof is not a single prompt wrapper. The app runs a structured investigation loop:

- Extracts normalized claims from messy human job text.
- Chooses evidence tools based on the claims it finds.
- Calls company, reputation, comparable-role, and local-footprint tools.
- Combines tool output with a transparent evidence-weighted risk policy.
- Returns a report designed for human decisions and downstream agents.

The same investigation core is reused by the web app, API, MCP endpoint, ChatSDK reply path, and workflow entrypoint.

## Packaging And Distribution

### Chrome Extension

Local install:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked".
4. Select the `extension/` folder.

Create the Chrome Web Store upload package:

```bash
npm run package:extension
```

Current upload/download copy:

```text
public/downloads/hireproof-extension.zip
```

The request body can include `text`, `url`, `image`, or a combination of these fields. `image` accepts a base64 data URL screenshot and uses the same OCR path as the web UI.

Build output:

```text
dist/chrome/hireproof-extension.zip
```

Generate store screenshots and promo image:

```bash
npm run store:assets
```

Generated assets:

```text
docs/chrome-web-store-assets/
+-- promo-small-440x280.png
+-- marquee-1400x560.png
+-- screenshot-popup-1280x800.png
+-- screenshot-context-menu-1280x800.png
`-- screenshot-verdict-1280x800.png
```

Listing copy, reviewer notes, privacy practices, and publication boundary are in [`docs/chrome-web-store-listing.md`](docs/chrome-web-store-listing.md). The full brand, social, platform, and store asset map is in [`docs/assets-index.md`](docs/assets-index.md). Extension privacy details are in [`extension/PRIVACY.md`](extension/PRIVACY.md).

### Native Automation Integrations

Build, test, and package the automation integrations:

```bash
pnpm integrations:build
pnpm integrations:test
pnpm integrations:package
```

Outputs:

```text
public/downloads/hireproof-native-integrations.zip
public/downloads/hireproof-n8n-workflow.json
public/downloads/hireproof-make-http-config.json
public/downloads/hireproof-langchain-tool.ts
public/downloads/hireproof-automation-curl.sh
```

Source packs:

```text
integrations/n8n-nodes-hireproof/
integrations/make-hireproof/
packages/hireproof-langchain/
```

Published npm packages:

```bash
npm install hireproof-sdk
npm install @hireproof/langchain @langchain/core zod
npm install n8n-nodes-hireproof
npx @hireproof/cli --help
```

Marketplace submission steps are in [`docs/automation-marketplace-submission.md`](docs/automation-marketplace-submission.md). Screenshot proof requirements are in [`docs/evidence-screenshot-checklist.md`](docs/evidence-screenshot-checklist.md).

### HireProof CLI

Run the published terminal product surface:

```bash
npx @hireproof/cli --help
npx @hireproof/cli tui
npx @hireproof/cli health
npx @hireproof/cli audit --text "Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Telegram only." --mode demo
```

Run the local terminal product surface from the repo:

```bash
npm run cli -- --help
npm run cli -- tui
npm run cli -- health
npm run cli -- audit --text "Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Telegram only." --mode demo
```

The CLI keeps direct commands automation-safe while `hireproof`/`hireproof tui` opens a branded terminal console with the Shield Sentinel mascot, guided audit flows, command autocomplete, health/config tools, recent report summaries, and local Ask HireProof answers from the selected report.

Theme-aware CLI proof screenshots:

```text
public/cli-tui-screenshot.png
public/cli-tui-screenshot-dark.png
```

CLI package details are in [`packages/hireproof-cli/README.md`](packages/hireproof-cli/README.md). Public docs are at [`/docs/cli`](https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/docs/cli). npm package page: [`@hireproof/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hireproof/cli).

Publishing note: do not run `npm publish` from the repo root. The root app is private and has a `prepublishOnly` blocker. For future package releases, bump the workspace version first, then publish that workspace only.

### Docker Self-Hosting

Build and run the production image:

```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
npm run docker:smoke
```

Docker behavior:

- Uses Next.js standalone output.
- Runs as a non-root user.
- Exposes port `3002`.
- Includes a `/api/health` container healthcheck.
- Uses environment variables for live model, search, Redis, and workflow credentials.

Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill only what you need.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Recommended | Base URL for internal links and callbacks. |
| `AGENT_API_KEY` | Recommended | API key accepted by `/api/v1/audit` and `/api/mcp`. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Recommended | Session signing secret for auth. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Live mode preferred | Vercel AI Gateway key. |
| `VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Live mode optional | Alias accepted for AI Gateway. |
| `HIREPROOF_MODEL` | Optional | Model path, defaults to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`. |
| `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEY` | Live mode fallback | OpenAI-compatible fallback provider key. |
| `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | Live evidence | SerpApi key for search-backed evidence. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Optional | Upstash REST URL for persistence and rate limits. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Optional | Upstash REST token. |
| `REDIS_URL` | ChatSDK | Redis URL for ChatSDK thread state. |
| `BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Hosted BYOK | Encrypts saved provider credentials in production. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack | Enables Slack bot replies. |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slack | Verifies Slack webhook signatures. |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord | Enables Discord replies. |
| `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | Discord | Verifies Discord interactions. |
| `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` | Discord | Discord application ID. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram | Enables Telegram replies. |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` | Telegram | Verifies Telegram webhooks. |

| `WORKFLOW_SECRET` | WDK | Protects workflow start routes. |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | Discord optional | Registers slash commands to one server for faster testing when running `npm run discord:commands`. |

Register Discord slash commands after setting the Discord env vars:

```bash
npm run discord:commands
```

Set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` for immediate server-scoped command registration during testing. Leave it unset for global commands, which can take longer to appear in Discord.

## Verification

Run the main local quality gates before handing off:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
node test/runtime-wiring.test.mjs
node test/byok-credentials.test.mjs
npm run package:extension
npm run store:assets
pnpm integrations:build
pnpm integrations:test
pnpm integrations:package
```

What those gates prove:

| Command | Proves |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | TypeScript contracts are valid outside generated Next build output. |
| `npm run build` | Production Next.js build succeeds. |
| `node test/runtime-wiring.test.mjs` | Runtime surfaces are wired to real endpoints and honest readiness states. |
| `node test/byok-credentials.test.mjs` | BYOK encryption, CSRF, and credential routing checks pass. |
| `npm run package:extension` | Chrome extension manifest/assets package into a clean upload ZIP. |
| `npm run store:assets` | Current Chrome Web Store screenshots and promotional assets are regenerated. |
| `pnpm integrations:build` | n8n, Make, LangChain, and download-template metadata validate. |
| `pnpm integrations:test` | Integration validators plus demo API smoke pass. |
| `pnpm integrations:package` | Native integration source bundle is regenerated. |

Optional Docker verification when Docker is available:

```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run
npm run docker:smoke
```

Production smoke commands:

```powershell
$base='https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app'
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$base/api/health"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$base/api/integrations/proof"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$base/api/v1/audit" `
  -Method Post `
  -ContentType 'application/json' `
  -Headers @{'x-api-key'='hireproof_agent_demo_key'} `
  -Body (@{
    text='Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Message us on Telegram.'
    mode='demo'
  } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

## Demo Scenarios

Three seeded audit scenarios are available without external keys:

- **High-Risk**: Telegram-based PHP 80,000/week internship scam.
- **Caution**: Ambiguous listing with incomplete company signals.
- **Safe**: Credible listing with matching company, role, and evidence.

These are intentional demo fixtures for deterministic judging and offline fallback. They should not be described as live evidence.

Demo fixture mode is clearly labeled in the UI, shows a snackbar warning, removes fake source links, and hides demo safer alternatives unless they come from sourced comparable-job evidence.

Runtime surfaces:

- Web UI uses `/api/audit` for streamed Server-Sent Events.
- External agents use `/api/v1/audit` for JSON responses and webhook callbacks.
- MCP-compatible clients use `/api/mcp` for direct tool execution.
- Chat platforms use `/api/webhooks/*` and the shared ChatSDK reply formatter.
- Durable background jobs start through `/api/workflows/audit`.
- Browser users can scan selected text or supported job pages through the Chrome extension.
