# HireProof Cursor Hackathon E2E Checkpoint Summary

Last updated: 2026-05-10, Asia/Manila

## Purpose

Keep the Cursor hackathon story active, evidence-first, and focused on moving HireProof toward portfolio proof plus pilot validation.

## Product Surfaces

- `/portfolio`: public case study for the shipped product, proof points, build decisions, and Cursor hackathon framing.
- `/pilot`: pilot intake page for communities, schools, recruiters, job boards, and developer integrations.
- `/pilot/admin`: authenticated pilot request export and lightweight product analytics view.
- `/docs/pilot`: 90-day operating plan and public positioning boundary.
- `/audit`: first-time demo shortcuts for High-Risk, Caution, and Safe sample reports.

## Positioning

- Lead with what shipped: app, API, proof pages, packages, docs, cost guardrails, and pilot path.
- Keep the hackathon framing active and focused on what is shipped, verified, and ready to test.
- Avoid unsupported claims: no generic fraud-platform pivot, guaranteed detection, marketplace approval, continuous learning, or unverified completed workflow proof.

## Pilot Path

1. Keep public demo and proof pages live.
2. Keep serious live provider usage BYOK-first or API-key gated.
3. Run 3-5 small pilots with job-seeker communities, schools, recruiters, job boards, or builders.
4. Measure repeat use, false positives, export usage, API demand, and willingness to bring provider credentials.
5. Add billing only after repeated pilot usage is proven.

## Verification Checklist

- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `node --test test/runtime-wiring.test.mjs`: passed, 45/45 tests after the stored-pilot and analytics pass.
- `npm run build`: passed, including `/portfolio` and `/pilot`.
- Local Playwright checks passed for `/`, `/audit?demo=high-risk`, `/portfolio`, `/pilot`, and `/docs/pilot` on desktop and mobile with no horizontal overflow.
- Local pilot intake form check passed: submit button starts disabled and enables after required fields are filled.
- Local demo API check passed through `/api/v1/audit` with `verdict: high-risk`, `riskScore: 92`, `mode: demo`, and `credentialMode: demo`.
- Production deploy `dpl_42nS9zk9y94e3qZEqWChhKkwqgsK` completed and aliased to `https://hireproof.tech`.
- Production HTTP checks returned `200` for `/`, `/audit?demo=high-risk`, `/portfolio`, `/pilot`, `/docs/pilot`, and `/api/health`.
- Production Playwright checks passed for `/`, `/audit?demo=high-risk`, `/portfolio`, `/pilot`, and `/docs/pilot` on desktop and mobile with no horizontal overflow.
- Production demo API check passed through `/api/v1/audit` with `verdict: high-risk`, `riskScore: 92`, `mode: demo`, and `credentialMode: demo`.
- Production deploy `dpl_7oZcyaa4R9eGg64Kk3KP53DhzBur` completed and aliased to `https://hireproof.tech` after the stored-pilot and analytics pass.
- Production HTTP checks returned `200` for `/pilot` and `/pilot/admin`.
- Production authenticated admin APIs returned the expected `401` when logged out: `/api/pilot/requests`, `/api/pilot/requests/export`, and `/api/developer/analytics`.
- Production analytics event write returned `200` from `/api/analytics/events`.
- Production pilot request validation returned `400` for an invalid same-origin request without storing a fake lead.
- Production Playwright checks passed for `/pilot`, `/pilot/admin`, `/portfolio`, and `/audit?demo=high-risk` on desktop and mobile with no horizontal overflow.
- Production demo login check returned `403 Demo login is not enabled`, so authenticated live admin/export verification still requires a real login or enabling `DEMO_LOGIN_ENABLED`.
- Production deploy `dpl_BUWad8vUrwqJpyHkVcnG4uB29mzV` completed and aliased to `https://hireproof.tech` after pilot lead triage, admin filters, and authenticated product-event CSV export were added.
- Production Playwright checks passed for `/pilot/admin` on desktop and mobile and `/pilot` on mobile with no horizontal overflow.
- Production protected API checks returned expected `401` when logged out for `/api/pilot/requests`, `/api/pilot/requests/export`, `/api/developer/analytics`, and `/api/developer/analytics/export`.
- Production analytics event write returned `200` from `/api/analytics/events` after the latest deploy.
- Personal portfolio repo `Iron-Mark/Portfolio-Mark-Siazon` was cloned to `C:\Codes Local\__ Side Projects\Portfolio-Mark-Siazon`, updated with a HireProof case study section, deployed as Vercel production `dpl_Ftwg3oDjHDd2iQeQf5yG3oqWV7ys`, and verified live at `https://www.marksiazon.dev` and `https://mark-siazon-portfolio.vercel.app`.
- Portfolio checks passed: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, local Playwright desktop/mobile on `http://localhost:3011`, and live Playwright desktop/mobile with no horizontal overflow.

## Proof Artifacts

- GitHub repo metadata now points homepage to `https://hireproof.tech/portfolio`.
- GitHub description now mentions the live case study and pilot intake.
- GitHub topics now include `pilot`, `portfolio`, `job-verification`, and `ai-safety`.
- Copy-ready post drafts are stored in `docs/cursor-hackathon-public-posts.md`.
- Copy-ready pilot outreach messages are stored in `docs/pilot-outreach-pack.md`.
- Proof asset usage notes are stored in `docs/cursor-hackathon-proof-assets.md`.

## Personal Portfolio

The external portfolio app now includes HireProof as the first featured project plus a dedicated latest-case-study section that links to the case study, demo, and pilot intake.

Remaining external action: commit/push the portfolio repo if this update should be preserved in GitHub source history. This was not done because the current request did not include a checkpoint commit or push authorization.
