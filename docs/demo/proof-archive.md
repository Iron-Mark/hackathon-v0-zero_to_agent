# HireProof Demo Proof Archive

Last checked: 2026-05-03

This file keeps the judge-facing proof artifacts in one place. It intentionally avoids secrets, request headers, tokens, and private Slack workspace identifiers.

## Current Proof Status

| Capability | Current status | Evidence | Do not claim yet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web audit demo | Live-proven | Production `/api/v1/audit` demo mode returns High-Risk score `92`. | N/A |
| Web audit live mode | Live-proven | Production `/api/v1/audit` live mode returns a credential-backed High-Risk report. | N/A |
| Slack ChatSDK | Live-proven | Real Slack mention screenshot plus production Slack route readiness. | Fresh Slack logs unless a new mention is captured. |
| Vercel Workflow / WDK | Accepted-run proven | Production workflow route returned accepted run ID `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`. | Completed durable callback report. |
| Discord ChatSDK | Credential-ready | Production credentials and webhook readiness pass; shared reply path passes. | Live Discord bot delivery until screenshots/logs are captured. |
| Telegram ChatSDK | Live delivery proven | Real Telegram message screenshot plus matching production webhook log. | Report-link screenshot until the platform reply base-URL fallback is re-tested live. |

| HireProof CLI TUI | npm-published and repo-rendered proof | `@hireproof/cli@1.0.0` is public on npm; light and dark terminal UI screenshots are generated from the repo-shipped Ink TUI. | Future CLI version bumps until separately published. |
| SDK and agent packages | npm-published | `hireproof-sdk@1.0.0`, `@hireproof/langchain@1.0.0`, and `n8n-nodes-hireproof@1.0.0` are public on npm. | Make Custom App review and n8n directory/community verification until external review evidence exists. |

Use this one-line status in public/demo materials:

> HireProof is production-verified for the web audit flow, Slack proof, and Telegram live delivery proof. Discord real message proof and Discord real message proof is still pending.

## Production URL

- Stable demo: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`
- Latest verified production deployment: `https://hireproof-bdvxyu0k1-iron-marks-projects.vercel.app`
- Latest verified deployment ID: `dpl_HSd4UqgThX6kPQxbDjYAfLjfkyHi`
- Production demos should use the stable alias; deployment-specific URLs are kept only as proof evidence.

## Readiness Proof

Production `GET /api/integrations/proof` returned:

- Status: `ready`
- ChatSDK Slack: `ready`
- Vercel Workflow / WDK: `ready`
- AI Gateway: `ready`

Production `GET /api/health` returned:

- Status: `ok`
- Storage: `redis`
- Model configured: `true`
- AI Gateway provider: `true`

Production `POST /api/v1/audit` with the public demo key returned:

- Verdict: `high-risk`
- Risk score: `92`
- Mode: `demo`
- Credential mode: `demo`
- Source: `api`

Production `POST /api/v1/audit` with platform live credentials returned:

- Verdict: `high-risk`
- Risk score: `100`
- Mode: `live`
- Credential mode: `platform-env`
- Live extraction returned company text from the submitted sample and completed with a High-Risk verdict.

Production `POST /api/audit` returns an SSE result event containing the High-Risk report.

## ChatSDK Slack Proof

- Proof type: real Slack mention to `@HireProof`
- Result: HireProof returned a High-Risk verdict with score, top red flags, and checked evidence categories.
- Screenshot: [`Screenshot 2026-04-30 024756.jpg`](Screenshot%202026-04-30%20024756.jpg)
- Public webhook route: `POST /api/webhooks/slack`
- Local formatted-reply route for demos: `POST /api/chat/hireproof`
- Log archive status: recent Vercel searches for `/api/webhooks/slack` and `Slack` returned no matching archived logs for the original screenshot event. Keep the screenshot as the proof artifact unless a fresh Slack mention is captured.

Use this claim in the submission:

> ChatSDK is live-tested in Slack with screenshot proof. A real `@HireProof` mention returned a High-Risk job-scam verdict.

## ChatSDK Telegram Proof

- Proof type: real Telegram message to `@HireProof_Bot`
- Test time: `2026-05-03 12:04:35 +08:00`
- Result: HireProof returned a High-Risk fake-check job scam verdict with score `92/100`.
- Screenshot: [`telegram-live-proof-2026-05-03-1204.jpg`](telegram-live-proof-2026-05-03-1204.jpg)
- Public webhook route: `POST /api/webhooks/telegram`
- Vercel log ID: `2hsl6-1777781075271-b6a2a1aed71e`
- Deployment ID: `dpl_6TjhCCdSocm1raRNas7vhJEXCVSy`
- Domain: `hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`
- Response: `200`
- Log evidence: production request reached `/api/webhooks/telegram`, initialized the Telegram adapter for `HireProof_Bot`, and returned HTTP `200`.
- Report link status: the captured Telegram reply did not include the `/audit/chat_...` link because the platform webhook path needed a base-URL fallback. The fallback is now patched; capture one more Telegram screenshot after deployment to close the report-link proof item.

Use this claim in the submission after the report-link retest is captured:

> Telegram is live-tested with screenshot and Vercel webhook log proof. A real `@HireProof_Bot` message returned a High-Risk fake-check job-scam verdict and a saved report link.

## Multi-Platform ChatSDK Controlled Check

Latest controlled check artifact:

- File: `docs/demo/live-chat-proof-check-latest.json`
- Strict file: `docs/demo/live-chat-proof-check-strict-latest.json`
- Command: `npm run proof:chat-live`
- Checked production base URL: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`

Result:

- Core status: `ready` when Slack, Workflow, and AI Gateway are ready.
- Optional platform status tracks future adapters internally until live proof exists.
- Slack: `ready`
- Discord: `ready`
- Telegram: `ready`
- optional provider adapters: `backend-gated`
- Production health: `ok`
- Shared ChatSDK reply path: returned `200`, verdict `high-risk`
- Shared reply proof report: see the latest `sharedChatReplyPath.reportUrl` value in the JSON artifact.

Missing production provider credentials:

- optional provider adapters: provider credentials

Use this claim until Discord real message screenshots are captured and Telegram report-link proof is re-tested:

> Telegram live delivery is screenshot/log-proven. Discord is production credential-ready and webhook-configured, but still needs real message screenshots and matching logs. optional provider adapters remain backend-gated.

Strict live platform proof status:

- Command: `npm run proof:chat-live:strict`
- Latest result: not passing yet because optional provider adapters remain credential-gated, Discord real event evidence is still pending, and Telegram still needs a report-link retest screenshot.
- Honest status: Telegram live delivery is proven by screenshot/log; Discord is credential-ready; optional provider adapters are credential-gated.

## Live Platform Proof Runbook

Run this for Discord and Telegram now; keep future provider-adapter proof internal until credentials and real events are available.

1. Deploy the latest `main` build to production.
2. Confirm `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/api/health` returns `ok`.
3. Confirm the Discord app credentials in Vercel production env.
4. Send one real Discord message or interaction to the bot.
5. Capture the Discord client screenshot and the matching production webhook log.
6. Confirm the Telegram bot credentials in Vercel production env.
7. Send one real Telegram message to the bot.
8. Capture the Telegram client screenshot and the matching production webhook log.
9. Add future provider-adapter proof only after credentials and real events are available.
10. Send one real optional provider adapters event.
11. Capture the optional provider adapters client screenshot and the matching production webhook log.
12. Run `npm run proof:chat-live`.
13. Run `npm run proof:chat-live:strict` after all three providers have credentials and event proof.
14. Update this archive with the new screenshots, log IDs, deployment ID, and strict proof result.

Pass criteria:

- Each provider has `ready` status in `docs/demo/live-chat-proof-check-latest.json`.
- `npm run proof:chat-live:strict` exits `0`.
- Each provider has one screenshot and one matching webhook log entry.
- Public copy no longer says credential-gated for any provider that has passed real event proof.

## Vercel Workflow / WDK Proof

Production `POST /api/workflows/audit` returned:

- HTTP status: `202`
- Status: `accepted`
- Track: `Vercel Workflow`
- Run ID: `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`
- Message: `Workflow run accepted by WDK.`
- Callback URL used for proof: `https://example.com/hireproof-callback`
- Report base URL: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/audit/[id]`

Vercel logs showed the WDK request:

- Log ID: `bjphw-1777488925775-e90c0f5c6010`
- Deployment ID: `dpl_GbQ2SAk34UZgnKvfr3eK3GVJRXAo`
- Domain: `hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`
- Method/path: `POST /api/workflows/audit`
- Response: `202`
- Environment: `production`

Use this claim in the submission:

> WDK has a production-accepted workflow run. The route started a deployed workflow and returned run ID `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`.

Do not claim a completed durable report callback unless a callback result is captured separately.

## HireProof CLI TUI Proof

- Proof type: repo-rendered terminal UI screenshots.
- CLI source: `packages/hireproof-cli`.
- Public docs: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/docs/cli`.
- Light screenshot: `public/cli-tui-screenshot.png`.
- Dark screenshot: `public/cli-tui-screenshot-dark.png`.
- npm package: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hireproof/cli`.
- Verified commands: `npm run cli:test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm pack --workspace @hireproof/cli --dry-run`.

Use this claim in the submission:

> HireProof also ships as a local terminal product surface: a tested CLI with rich audit reports, an Ink-based Shield Sentinel TUI, Tab autocomplete, health/config tools, recent report summaries, and clean JSON for automations.

The CLI npm package is public. Keep version-specific claims to `1.0.0` until a new package version is published.

## Published npm Package Proof

- `@hireproof/cli@1.0.0`: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hireproof/cli`
- `@hireproof/langchain@1.0.0`: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hireproof/langchain`
- `hireproof-sdk@1.0.0`: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/hireproof-sdk`
- `n8n-nodes-hireproof@1.0.0`: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-hireproof`

Use this claim in the submission:

> HireProof ships with four public npm packages: a rich CLI/TUI, a LangChain agent tool, a typed SDK, and an n8n community-node package.

Do not claim Make marketplace approval or n8n directory/community verification until those external review artifacts are captured.

## Final Demo Order

1. Open `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/audit`.
2. Paste the suspicious remote frontend internship sample.
3. Show the High-Risk report, red flags, and evidence sections.
4. Show the Slack screenshot proof.
5. Show `/proof` or `/docs/cli` for the CLI TUI screenshot proof.
6. Mention the WDK accepted run ID and the `/api/workflows/audit` proof route.

- [ ] `npm run proof:chat-live:strict` passes after Discord/Telegram/provider adapters credentials and live event proof exist.
- [ ] Final copy avoids claiming live Discord or provider adapters proof before real platform captures exist, and avoids claiming Telegram report-link proof until the follow-up screenshot includes the link.

## Demo Failure Backup

- If live search is slow, use the seeded High-Risk sample: `Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Message us on Telegram.`
- If the live audit stream stalls, open a saved `/audit/chat_...` or previous High-Risk report link.
- If Slack cannot be shown live, use the archived Slack screenshot proof.
- If WDK cannot be re-run, cite the production accepted run ID `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`.
- If Discord screenshots/logs are unavailable, use the exact phrase: "credential-ready, not live-proven yet."
- If Telegram report-link proof is unavailable, use the exact phrase: "live delivery proven, report link retest pending."
- If provider adapters credentials are unavailable, use the exact phrase: "implemented and credential-gated, not live-proven yet."

## Claim Language

Use these claims:

- Live-proven: production web audit flow, public API smoke, Slack screenshot proof, Telegram delivery proof, and WDK accepted run.
- Build-verified: multi-platform ChatSDK routes, Chrome extension packaging, BYOK route hardening, and export paths.
- Credential-ready: Discord until a real provider event is captured.
- Internal only: future provider adapters until credentials and real provider events are captured.

Avoid these claims until evidence exists:

- "Live on Discord."
- "Live on Telegram."
- "Live on provider adapters."
- "Workflow completed a long-running investigation callback."
