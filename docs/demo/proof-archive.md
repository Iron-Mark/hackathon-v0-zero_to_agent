# HireProof Demo Proof Archive

Last checked: 2026-05-01

This file keeps the judge-facing proof artifacts in one place. It intentionally avoids secrets, request headers, tokens, and private Slack workspace identifiers.

## Current Proof Status

| Capability | Current status | Evidence | Do not claim yet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web audit demo | Live-proven | Production `/api/v1/audit` demo mode returns High-Risk score `92`. | N/A |
| Web audit live mode | Live-proven | Production `/api/v1/audit` live mode returns a credential-backed High-Risk report. | N/A |
| Slack ChatSDK | Live-proven | Real Slack mention screenshot plus production Slack route readiness. | Fresh Slack logs unless a new mention is captured. |
| Vercel Workflow / WDK | Accepted-run proven | Production workflow route returned accepted run ID `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`. | Completed durable callback report. |
| Discord ChatSDK | Credential-gated | Route exists and controlled shared reply path passes; provider credentials are missing. | Live Discord bot delivery. |
| Telegram ChatSDK | Credential-gated | Route exists and controlled shared reply path passes; provider credentials are missing. | Live Telegram bot delivery. |
| WhatsApp/Zernio ChatSDK | Credential-gated | Route exists and controlled shared reply path passes; provider credentials are missing. | Live WhatsApp delivery. |

Use this one-line status in public/demo materials:

> HireProof is production-verified for the web audit flow and Slack proof. Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp/Zernio are implemented behind credential gates and still need live provider event proof.

## Production URL

- Stable demo: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`
- Latest verified production deployment: `https://hireproof-bdvxyu0k1-iron-marks-projects.vercel.app`
- Latest verified deployment ID: `dpl_HSd4UqgThX6kPQxbDjYAfLjfkyHi`
- Production demos should use the stable alias; deployment-specific URLs are kept only as proof evidence.

## Readiness Proof

Production `GET /api/integrations/proof` returned:

- Status: `ready`
- ChatSDK Slack: `ready`
- Vercel Workflow / WDK: `ready`
- AI Gateway: `ready`

Production `GET /api/health` returned:

- Status: `ok`
- Storage: `redis`
- Model configured: `true`
- AI Gateway provider: `true`

Production `POST /api/v1/audit` with the public demo key returned:

- Verdict: `high-risk`
- Risk score: `92`
- Mode: `demo`
- Credential mode: `demo`
- Source: `api`

Production `POST /api/v1/audit` with platform live credentials returned:

- Verdict: `high-risk`
- Risk score: `100`
- Mode: `live`
- Credential mode: `platform-env`
- Live extraction returned company text from the submitted sample and completed with a High-Risk verdict.

Production `POST /api/audit` returns an SSE result event containing the High-Risk report.

## ChatSDK Slack Proof

- Proof type: real Slack mention to `@HireProof`
- Result: HireProof returned a High-Risk verdict with score, top red flags, and checked evidence categories.
- Screenshot: [`Screenshot 2026-04-30 024756.jpg`](Screenshot%202026-04-30%20024756.jpg)
- Public webhook route: `POST /api/webhooks/slack`
- Local formatted-reply route for demos: `POST /api/chat/hireproof`
- Log archive status: recent Vercel searches for `/api/webhooks/slack` and `Slack` returned no matching archived logs for the original screenshot event. Keep the screenshot as the proof artifact unless a fresh Slack mention is captured.

Use this claim in the submission:

> ChatSDK is live-tested in Slack with screenshot proof. A real `@HireProof` mention returned a High-Risk job-scam verdict.

## Multi-Platform ChatSDK Controlled Check

Latest controlled check artifact:

- File: `docs/demo/live-chat-proof-check-latest.json`
- Strict file: `docs/demo/live-chat-proof-check-strict-latest.json`
- Command: `npm run proof:chat-live`
- Checked production base URL: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`

Result:

- Slack: `ready`
- Discord: `credential-gated`
- Telegram: `credential-gated`
- WhatsApp/Zernio: `credential-gated`
- Production health: `ok`
- Shared ChatSDK reply path: returned `200`, verdict `high-risk`
- Shared reply proof report: see the latest `sharedChatReplyPath.reportUrl` value in the JSON artifact.

Missing production provider credentials:

- Discord: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`
- Telegram: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`
- WhatsApp/Zernio: `ZERNIO_API_KEY`, `ZERNIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

Use this claim until provider credentials and real message screenshots are captured:

> Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp/Zernio are implemented and production-reachable behind credential gates. The shared ChatSDK reply path is production-verified, but external provider event delivery is still pending live credentials and real message captures.

Strict live platform proof status:

- Command: `npm run proof:chat-live:strict`
- Latest result: failed as expected because Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp/Zernio have no production provider credentials yet.
- Honest status: implemented, build-verified, and production-reachable; not end-to-end live-proven on those external platforms.

## Live Platform Proof Runbook

Run this only after the missing provider credentials are added to production.

1. Deploy the latest `main` build to production.
2. Confirm `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/api/health` returns `ok`.
3. Add the Discord app credentials in Vercel production env.
4. Send one real Discord message or interaction to the bot.
5. Capture the Discord client screenshot and the matching production webhook log.
6. Add the Telegram bot credentials in Vercel production env.
7. Send one real Telegram message to the bot.
8. Capture the Telegram client screenshot and the matching production webhook log.
9. Add the WhatsApp/Zernio credentials in Vercel production env.
10. Send one real WhatsApp/Zernio event.
11. Capture the WhatsApp/Zernio client screenshot and the matching production webhook log.
12. Run `npm run proof:chat-live`.
13. Run `npm run proof:chat-live:strict`.
14. Update this archive with the new screenshots, log IDs, deployment ID, and strict proof result.

Pass criteria:

- Each provider has `ready` status in `docs/demo/live-chat-proof-check-latest.json`.
- `npm run proof:chat-live:strict` exits `0`.
- Each provider has one screenshot and one matching webhook log entry.
- Public copy no longer says credential-gated for any provider that has passed real event proof.

## Vercel Workflow / WDK Proof

Production `POST /api/workflows/audit` returned:

- HTTP status: `202`
- Status: `accepted`
- Track: `Vercel Workflow`
- Run ID: `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`
- Message: `Workflow run accepted by WDK.`
- Callback URL used for proof: `https://example.com/hireproof-callback`
- Report base URL: `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/audit/[id]`

Vercel logs showed the WDK request:

- Log ID: `bjphw-1777488925775-e90c0f5c6010`
- Deployment ID: `dpl_GbQ2SAk34UZgnKvfr3eK3GVJRXAo`
- Domain: `hireproof-sigma.vercel.app`
- Method/path: `POST /api/workflows/audit`
- Response: `202`
- Environment: `production`

Use this claim in the submission:

> WDK has a production-accepted workflow run. The route started a deployed workflow and returned run ID `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`.

Do not claim a completed durable report callback unless a callback result is captured separately.

## Final Demo Order

1. Open `https://hireproof-sigma.vercel.app/audit`.
2. Paste the suspicious remote frontend internship sample.
3. Show the High-Risk report, red flags, and evidence sections.
4. Show the Slack screenshot proof.
5. Mention the WDK accepted run ID and the `/api/workflows/audit` proof route.

- [ ] Final copy avoids claiming live Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp proof before real platform captures exist.

## Demo Failure Backup

- If live search is slow, use the seeded High-Risk sample: `Remote frontend intern. PHP 80,000/week. No interview. Message us on Telegram.`
- If the live audit stream stalls, open a saved `/audit/chat_...` or previous High-Risk report link.
- If Slack cannot be shown live, use the archived Slack screenshot proof.
- If WDK cannot be re-run, cite the production accepted run ID `wrun_01KQD9H6AND3W7YZBHHKAH2KV5`.
- If Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp credentials are unavailable, use the exact phrase: "implemented and credential-gated, not live-proven yet."

## Claim Language

Use these claims:

- Live-proven: production web audit flow, public API smoke, Slack screenshot proof, and WDK accepted run.
- Build-verified: multi-platform ChatSDK routes, Chrome extension packaging, BYOK route hardening, and export paths.
- Credential-gated: Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp/Zernio until real provider events are captured.

Avoid these claims until evidence exists:

- "Live on Discord."
- "Live on Telegram."
- "Live on WhatsApp."
- "Workflow completed a long-running investigation callback."
