## GitHub Packages

Workflow run:

- https://github.com/Iron-Mark/hackathon-v0-zero_to_agent/actions/runs/25360061938
- Status: completed
- Conclusion: success

Published package alias jobs:

- `@iron-mark/hireproof-cli`: success
- `@iron-mark/hireproof-langchain`: success
- `@iron-mark/n8n-nodes-hireproof`: success

Direct package listing through the current CLI token is blocked by GitHub API permissions:

- `gh api /users/Iron-Mark/packages?package_type=npm`
- Result: HTTP 403, current token needs `read:packages`

Manual visual confirmation should be done from the logged-in GitHub Packages page:

- https://github.com/Iron-Mark?tab=packages&repo_name=hackathon-v0-zero_to_agent

## Local Verification

Commands run successfully:

- `npm run lint`
- `node --test test/runtime-wiring.test.mjs`
- `npm run build`

Runtime wiring test result:

- 43 tests
- 43 passing
- 0 failing

Production build result:

- Next.js 16.2.4
- Compiled successfully
- TypeScript completed
- 84 static pages generated

## Browser And Responsive Proof

Playwright checked the live site across these viewport sizes:

- `320x568`
- `390x844`
- `768x1024`
- `1024x768`
- `1366x768`
- `1440x900`

Routes checked:

- `/`
- `/audit`
- `/docs`

Interaction checks:

- Docs mobile menu clicked successfully
- Audit primary action clicked successfully
- Docs search control was hidden in the checked mobile state, not broken
- No horizontal overflow errors were detected

- `artifacts/final-release-proof/docs-mobile-interactions-390x844.png`
- `artifacts/final-release-proof/audit-mobile-interaction-390x844.png`

## Residual Risk

- GitHub Packages visibility still needs account-level visual confirmation because the current CLI token cannot list packages without `read:packages`.
- WhatsApp remains intentionally credential-gated because `ZERNIO_API_KEY` and `ZERNIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are not configured.
